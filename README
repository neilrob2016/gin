Compilation
===========
This is a small Gin Rummy game I wrote to kill time. Its been compiled and 
tested on Linux and MacOS but should compile on most unix systems as it just 
uses standard libc calls. The only difference with MacOS is that it calls the 
speech subsystem using exec to speak the moves. To compile simply type "make".


Running
=======
Compilation creates a binary called "gin" which can be run with no options to
start a user vs computer game. Enter -h on the command line to see the command
line options. There will be extra options related to speech on MacOS.


Colour
======
Buy default the game uses ANSI colour. Use the -c option to switch it off.


Game
====
This game has a couple of minor differences to the official rules that don't
affect the gameplay but made programming slightly simpler:

1) You must meld down to or below the min knock value before you can knock. You 
   cannot knock then meld.
2) If the other player knocks you cannot meld with the next card on the deck top
   without taking it into your hand first with an exchange. 

For help with game commands enter 'h' and the command line.
